                <h1> Concepting the game </h1>
                <img src="/Articles/Archive/4WhyDoesScopeMatter/Scope.png" width="150" height="150" />
                <p>
                    Video game scope is the size and complexity of the video game. Games like Cyberpunk 2077, Anthem, the Day before all had some amount of Game Scope issues. There are quite a few reasons why game scope is so important. We will be discussing the 4 main ones in this blog post.
                </p>
                <ul><li>1. Resource Management</li></ul>
                <p>
                    There are three parts of resource management. The first resource is <b>Time</b>. Defining scope of the project helps with estimating the full length of the project as well as estimating each development phase. Naming features and content and giving specific time frames can help create a realistic timeline, avoiding rashes or incomplete work. However, this is not perfect and all estimates, are still estimates
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second resource is <b>Budget</b>. Although people don't want to publicly say this, video games are almost always made to make money. Having a budget considered in your game scope helps to make sure you are profitable. If a game costs $10,000 to make but you only make $2,500. You lost $7,500. A solo dev or indie dev can't have that happen. Costs like salaries, software licenses, marketing and other expenses need to be considered in the budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last resource is <b>Talent</b>. Larger the team, the more talent you will have. A smaller team will need people with more “Hats”. Meaning more people will need to have more roles and develop new skills to get the game out. If you are a solo dev, then you need to know all the hats. Talent depends on how crazy the formal elements of the game are. If a game is complex game mechanics, more programmers. If a game has good graphics, you need more artists.
                </p>
                <ul><li>2. Focus and Quality</li></ul>
                <p>
                    Focus and Quality comprise three parts. The biggest one being <b>avoiding scope creep</b>. Scope creep is when new features or changes are added continuously, leading to delays and potential compromises in quality. Designers and Developers need to make sure scope is manageable, stays close to original vision and maintains high standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next part of Focus and Quality is <b>Polish</b>. Keep the scope narrow, spend more time refining and perfecting key elements of the game. This will lead to an overall higher quality product. Start small, have good quality and it will pay off in the end. Everyone much rather have a really good small game then a horrible giant one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, <b>feature prioritization</b>. Prioritizing features helps make sure core elements that greatly impact the players game experience are dealt with first. A feature like combat in a fighting game is more important than choosing a map. So in that example combat should have top priority than choosing a map should have the next priority.
                </p>
                <ul><li>3. Feasibility</li></ul>
                <ul><li>4. Risk Management</li></ul>
